Build Instructions for Windows
==============================

How to build the binary windows version of the XIG:


1. Install the *32-bit* version of Python from http://www.python.org
  
   Any v2.7 series, 32-bit version of Python will do.
 
2. Install the python v2.7 version of py2exe:

   Visit http://py2exe.org/index.cgi/FrontPage, navigate to the
   downloads page, and download the v2.7 series installer.

3. Run the build script from this directory (build-bin/osx/build.sh):

   X:\xig\build-bin\windows> C:\python27\python.exe setup.py py2exe

4. Once the build is complete, a distribution zip archive will be
   created. That's it!
